            	<p>... and hello! I'm <a href="http://flrec.ifas.ufl.edu/geomatics/people/levente-juhasz/index.html" target="_blank">Levente</a>, a PhD Candidate in the <a href="http://flrec.ifas.ufl.edu/geomatics/" target="_blank">Geomatics Program</a> at the University of Florida. I built this website to gather some awesome people who'd help me out in the last piece of my PhD research.</p>

		<p>My research aims to understand how people use different social media and online services and how this is reflected in the spatial footprints of users. To get to this point, I need data, reliable data... and lots of it. This is how <b>you can help</b>! I'd like to ask you to share your online profiles with me so I could conduct my research on a large database that allows to come up with meaningful conclusions. On this website, you can authenticate with different social media (and mapping, because mapping is fun!) providers and authorize my research tools to collect some information 

		<p>Excited about <b>helping out</b>? Go on and share your online profiles with me!</p>
