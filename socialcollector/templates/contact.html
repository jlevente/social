		<p>If you're wondering who's behind all this, here's some info of my background. My name is Levente Juh√°sz. Born and raised in Hungary, living in the Fort Lauderdale/Miami area while working on my PhD at the University of Florida. I hold an MSc in Geography from the University of Szeged, Hungary. Apart from UF, my previous research appointments include being a Visiting Scientist at the Digital Earth & Reference Data Unit at the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission in Ispra, Italy in 2014, and currently at the Carinthia University of Applied Sciences in Villach, Austria until June 2018. Outside academia, I worked as a GIS developer for a small consulting firm in Szeged Hungary, and also worked for a geospatial startup, Mapillary between 2015 and 2017. To date, I am the main author of 5 peer-reviewed journal articles and also authored several book chapters and papers in peer-reviewed conference proceedings in topics related to Volunteered Geographic Information and user generated geographic data.
